## c
**[evp_encrypt_decrypt.c](https://github.com/farslan/snippets/blob/master/c/evp_encrypt_decrypt.c)**

An OpenSSL EVP example that uses DES as encryption algorithm

**[hybrid_data.c](https://github.com/farslan/snippets/blob/master/c/hybrid_data.c), [hybrid_file.c](https://github.com/farslan/snippets/blob/master/c/hybrid_file.c)**

An OpenSSL example that uses RSA for key
encapsulation and DES for data encapsulation (Hybrid cryptosystem). The two
files are identical, however one uses a buffer as input data the other one uses
a file as input data.


## python
**[device_twisted.py](https://github.com/farslan/snippets/blob/master/python/device_twisted.py)**

A load test tool written with python-twisted. It's a simple
example that shows how to make multiple connections and sending data
periodically.
